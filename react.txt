react notes

important:
 - components: core building blocks
 - jsx: react's wrapper around js, let's you build components html-style
 - styling: make components look nice
 - props: pass data around application
 - state: maintain and change data in application
 - event handling: allows strong interactivity with users
 - lifecycle methods: can hook into different timing events of components
 - fetching data: from api using http
 - forms: good for UX

why react?
 - speed: uses the virtual DOM
 - can create reusable web components: sort of like html variables
 - maintained by facebook

ES6
 - ecmascript 6
 - var -> const, let

**
 - everything is going to have to tie back to an html page of some sort
 - the js we write will be boiled down to elements on a page


TODO
 - starter/legend options
 - implement algorithm (for non rand teams)
