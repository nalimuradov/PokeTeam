INPUT:
 - user picks a game 

OUTPUT:
 - system outputs good team

END GOAL:
 - user selects a game [eg. frlg, plat, etc]
 - user specifies size of team [1 to 6]
 - user can also pick some inital pkmn they know they want
 - system outputs a sample team * [figure out and algorithm]

 - user can click on one of the team members to replace
 - pretty much a team builder but with auto-generation

 algorithm:
 - no glaring weakness
 - even stat distribution



next steps:
 1) if user selects a game, output six random fully evolved pokemon sprites from that game
 2) implement option to allow outputs of 1 to 6
 3) user can pre-pick some pokemon they know they want [dynamic drop down text input]
 4) user can click on one of the sprites to replace with another random one
 5) create the algorithm*
 6) make nice UI
